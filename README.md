# Minesweeper solver


TODO:
- advanced algorithms
   - probability approach
   - pattern recognition
- add chording (wheel click)
- add remaining tile pictures and corresponding dictionary values
- fix game behavior after a bomb is clicked (colored flag, indication of correct guesses)
- use bomb counter in strategy?
